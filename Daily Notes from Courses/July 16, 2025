**DevOps and Testing**

- Isolation Issues:
1. Slow Software Delivery
2. Frequent errors and downtime
3. Inefficient processes
4. Limited visibility
5. Resistance to change
- Devops is a combination of development and operations
- CI/CD = continuous integration and continuous delivery
- Combination of these teams uses practices to automate processes
- Use a tech stack and tooling that helps them operate and evolve apps
- Introduces collaborative automated and approach to software delivery
- Promotes team autonomy, fast feedback, integrated tools and technical practices like CI and CD
- Benefits of Devops on Testing:
1. Fast feedback on the code quality
2. CI promotes shift-let approach
3. Automated Testing: devops promotes this
4. Increases view on non-functionality quality characteristics (performance)
5. Efficient regression testing
- Cons of Devops on Testing:
1. Devops delivery pipeline must be defined and establish
2. CI/CD tools must be introduced and maintained
3. Test automation requires additional resources
