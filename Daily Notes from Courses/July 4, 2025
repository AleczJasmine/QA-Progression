**Black-box Testing Techniques**

- Applied in system testing or acceptance testing
1. Equivalence Partitioning - divides the system into smaller partitions and each partition has a similar behavior
2. Boundary Value Analysis - same with equivalence but we focus on values on the boundaries
3. Decision Table Testing
4. State Transition Testing - going through different systems, login -> homefeed
5. Pairwise Testing - combination of different inputs (e.g search functionality)
- Just provide input and wait for output
- Also called “Behavioral-based Testing”

Equivalence Partitioning

- Equivalence partitioning is basically testing the system if it is properly doing what its needed to be done in a specific part of the process/partition
- Covering each partition in the system with one test case
- Identify the partitions, then for each partition, test each one time per day
- **Basically, You test just one value from each group instead of testing everything — because the system is expected to handle all values in that group the same.**
- A form only accepts numbers from **1 to 100**. You choose to test the values 0, 50, and 101.
- → This is a correct use of equivalence partitioning.
