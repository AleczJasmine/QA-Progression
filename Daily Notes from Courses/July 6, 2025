**Verification and Validation**

- Verification is whether the system the specified documents
- Validation checks whether the system will meet user and other stakeholder needs
- Verification + validation = doing the right thing in the right way

**What is Testing?**

- Testing is a big industry and has many branches
- Set of activities to discover defects and evaluate the quality of software artifacts
- **Artifacts are anything the development and testing teams produce to help create the software product**
- **Test objects are any artifact that is being tested**

**Testing and Debugging**

- Testing finds defects
- Debugging fixes these defects (a development activity)
- Debugging activities include:
    - Reproduction of a failure
    - Diagnosis (finding the root cause)
    - Fixing the cause
- Confirmation testing or re-testing is to test to check whether the bug was fixed
- Static testing points to the defect directly, debugging is concerned with removing it
    - No need for reproduction or diagnosis since static testing directly finds defects and cannot cause failures

**Does testing increase the quality of the software?**

- **No. Fixing bugs is a development activity not a testing activity. So testing simply builds confidence in the quality of the test object by providing higher-quality test objects**

**Testing’s Contributions to Success**

- Provides a cost-effective means of detecting defects

**Quality Assurance and testing**

- **Quality assurance -** “process-oriented”. The better the process, the better the software. “Process improvements”
    - If a good process is followed correctly, then it will generate a good product
    - A preventive approach
    - Test results in QA provide feedback on how well the development and processes perform
- **Testing -** “product-oriented”. It is a major form of **quality control**.
    - A corrective approach
    - Test results for QC are used to fix defects
