Shift-Left Approach
Principle of early testing
Does not wait for code to be implemented before testing
Shift-Left approach does the following:
Review specification
Write test cases before code is written
Continuous integration and continuous development
Begin implementing an automated process
Perform non-functional testing on component test-level
Retrospectives and Process Improvements
Does not include the end users
Retrospectives are frequent process improvements
Done at the end of each iteration
Notes what is and is not successful
Benefits of Retrospectives in Testing:
Increased effectiveness and efficiency
Increased quality of testing
Improved quality of test basis
Better collaboration
Test Levels
Groups of test activities
Unit testing-> component testing -> component integration testing -> system testing -> system integration testing -> acceptance testing
Characterizing Test Levels:
Specific Objectives
Test basis
Test objects
Specific approaches and responsibilities
Typical defects and failures
The 5 Main Test Levels:
Component Testing
Test components in a system
Testing unit per unit or component by component
Component Integration Testing
Testing interactions between components
System Testing
Overall behavior of the entire system
System Integration Testing
Several interfaces of a system
Acceptance Testing
Validation and readiness for deployment
