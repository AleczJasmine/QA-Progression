Section 2 talks about:
How testing is incorporated in other dev activities
Different Levels and types of testing
Maintenance Testing
SDLC Models
How activities are organized to create the software
Vary according to:
Objective
Discipline
Interest
Time to market
Documentation
Types of activity performed at each stage
Others
Testing depends on the SDLC model
Categories of SDLC Models
Sequential Development Models
Linear with sequential flow of activities
No overlaps of phases
Iterative &Incremental Development Models
Short cycle of activities that can be revisited any time
Sequential Development Models: Waterfall
Oldest and well known
Each stage must be completed before moving on to the next stage
Requirements Phase
From the user
Systems specification document
Functional specifications
Design Phase
Global design or architecture design or high-level design to map the system requirements
Detailed design or low-level design: very specific about the functions
Coding Phase
Developers code the detailed design of each module to software
Testing Phase
Towards the end of the project lifecycle
*Waterfall model is only a good model for very specific circumstances
