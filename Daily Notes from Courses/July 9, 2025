**Test Case Writing**

- One of the most important skills of a software tester
- A **test case** is a set of preconditions, inputs, actions and expected results developed based on the test conditions
- A **test condition/test scenario** (functionality, etc) is only one line where as the test case is one document
- Example: the one I do in google sheets

**Parts of a Test Case:**

1. Test Case Title: Verify login with valid username and password
2. Precondition: User is already registered using valid credentials
3. Test Steps: steps that need to be executed to run the test case
4. Expected result
5. Test Scenario (Test Suite): Where the test case belong to: example: Login
    1. A group where the related test cases belong to
6. Test Environment: Where Im going to test this application (example: Windows 11 - Chrome - Wifi Samsung)
7. Actual Result: only fill it up after executing the test case
8. Status: Not Started, Pass, Fail, Blocked/Skipped
