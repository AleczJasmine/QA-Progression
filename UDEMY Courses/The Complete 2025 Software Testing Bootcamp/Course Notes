**June 30, 2025 Notes**

**Roles in the Software Development Team**

- Requirements Engineers/Business Analyst/Product Owner
- SRS - outlines the complete and precise definition of a software product's intended behavior and performance
- BRD - focuses on the business need
    - BRD,SRS, User story
    - As a tester your job is to sometimes **write an acceptance criteria**
    - Your job as a tester is to review these BRD, find ambiguities, inconsistencies, any incompleteness
- UI/UX Designer
    - Figma. Wireframe
    - Test the design as a tester
    - Check if the requirements follow the design given
- Front-end, Back-end and Mobile Developers
    - Development
    - Front-end = test; Backend = test; Front-end+Backend = **integration testing**
- Project Manager & Scrum Master(for agile teams)
- Software Tester

**How software is developed - Software development lifecycle models**

1. Sequential Development
- Analysis -> Design -> Implementation->Testing
- Does not go back
- Waterfall model - testing is not early, not recommended
- V-Model (created due to drawbacks of waterfall)

VModel Testing:

- Requirements = Acceptance Testing (Creation of test analysis and design)
- Specification = System Testing (Creation of test scenarios and test cases)
- Architectural = Integration Testing (Creation of test integration cases)
- Detailed Design = Unit Testing (Creation of test driven development)
- Test Levels Meaning:
    - Unit Testing - dev; cares about how the software is developed
    - Acceptance Testing - what the user needs
    - Integration Testing - dev
    - System Testing - software tester
1. Agile Software Development
- Is not sequential
- Continuous Feedback
- Agile Manifesto = 4 values, 12 principles

2.1 Incremental and Iterative Development

- Incremental - each part is unusable as a whole
    - System is not usable not until the whole system is finished
- Iterative - each part can be usable
    - MVP - Minimum Valuable Product
- Scrum Process
    - Agile is a way of thinking
    - An approach to apply agile principles
    - User stories - written functionalities
    - Scrum is an iterative model
- Difference Between Sequential, Iterative and Incremental Development
    - Sequential
        - Fixed Requirements
        - Cannot change the requirements
    - Agile
        - Fixed Time
        - Fixed Effort
        - Estimated Requirements
        - Use “cone of uncertainty”
